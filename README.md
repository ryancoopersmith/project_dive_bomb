# Project Dive Bar

## Description:
Project Dive Bar is a chance for users to see reviews of Philadelphia dive bars.

While we offer an expert review, users can also add their own reviews that are up-voted and down-voted and sorted accordingly. We also incorporated the Google Maps API so users can get directions.
